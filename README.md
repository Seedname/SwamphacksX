Welcome to FireWatch!

FireWatch provides real-time wildfire tracking, allowing for both civilians and authorities to identify areas with potentially dangerous wildfires. 

With a dynamic map, we also provide routes so that firefighters in the air can find optimal travel paths to fires, as well as use water sources to their benefit. 

Furthermore, users can submit incident reports to notify the community of updates, situations, new fires, etc. This is stored in a database, and this data gets sent to authorities.

To prevent unauthorized users from submitting requests, we used Auth0 to authenticate and verify users.
